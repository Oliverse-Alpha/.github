# 🌌 Oliverse-Alpha  
This is the home for my work across **Music Technology**, **AI Engineering**, and **Drug Discovery Science**.  
Three disciplines, one creative and technical universe.  It helps keep me organized across my three main fields of study

---

## 🎧 Music Technology  
Explorations across sound, performance, and digital instrument design.

**Focus Areas**
- Multi-instrumental composition (Ableton, Cubase, FL Studio, Dorico, Sibelius, Reaper)  
- Electronic drumming systems, e-drum modules, and expressive MIDI setups  
- Sound design using SuperCollider, Pure Data, custom devices, and DSP chains  
- Music–visual integrations (TouchDesigner, Blender, fractal engines)  
- Workflow engineering for hybrid acoustic/electronic performance

## 🤖 Development & AI  
Software engineering and agentic AI that merge technical rigor with creative tooling.

**Focus Areas**
- Local LLM workflows (RTX Pro 6000 Blackwell), model tooling, and inference pipelines  
- REST/GraphQL APIs, Node.js, Express, Python, and full-stack systems  
- Automation using LangChain, PydanticAI, N8N, and multimodal processing tools  
- Data engineering for scientific, creative, and analytics applications  
- CLIs, utilities, desktop tools, workflow engines, and scientific integrators

## 🧪 Drug Discovery Scientist  
High-throughput and high-content benchtop experimentation, robotics, and computational pipelines for biochemistry.

**Focus Areas**
- Biochemical & cellular assay development (HTRF, AlphaLISA, DHCA/PHCA, EMSA, MSD)  
- Laboratory automation: Echo, Bravo, Firefly, Dragonfly, Thermo Momentum, iPSC workflows  
- Data analysis using R, Python, Spotfire, D360, scientific visualization pipelines  
- AI-driven scientific reporting, LLM assistants, ELN summarizers, and workflow automation  
- Translational and preclinical decision-making tools (SAR, Z’ scoring, QC, profiling)

## 🧭 About This Organization  
Oliverse-Alpha serves as a structured portfolio across three intersecting disciplines.  
It organizes selected repositories, tools, and experiments under clear domains.

**What This Organization Represents**
- A curated version of my broader GitHub presence  
- A cross-domain space where science, engineering, and music co-exist  
- A growing collection of experimental tools, research pipelines, and creative systems  
- A unified home for ongoing projects, prototypes, and long-term technical work  
- A way for collaborators, labs, or creative partners to quickly find relevant projects  

> A constellation of disciplines — connected by curiosity, experimentation, and a drive to build technically meaningful work.
