# 🌌 Oliverse-Alpha  
A home for my work across **Music Technology**, **AI Engineering**, and **Drug Discovery Science**.  
Three disciplines, one creative and technical universe.

Explore the lens that fits what you're here for:

---

## 🎧 Music Technology  
Experimental composition, electronic performance, MIDI systems, and audiovisual integrations.  
From e-drum expressivity to SuperCollider/PureData synthesis to procedural CGI workflows.

👉 **[View the Musician Profile →](../musician/README.md)**

---

## 🤖 Development & AI  
Software engineering, agentic AI, and full-stack tooling.  
I build local LLM workflows, REST/GraphQL APIs, multimodal pipelines, and automation systems that connect creative and scientific domains.

## 🧪 Drug Discovery Scientist  
High-throughput assay development, robotics, data engineering, and AI-driven reporting for translational research.  
Biochemistry, automation, and informatics woven into practical decision-making systems.

## 🧭 About This Organization  
Oliverse-Alpha is a curated layer on top of my broader work — a structured space where  
my creative, technical, and scientific projects live under one coherent identity.  

Each section highlights selected repositories, tools, and workflows aligned to its domain.

> A constellation of disciplines — connected by curiosity, engineering, and a drive to build things that matter.
