# 🎛 Music Technology  
A curated portfolio spanning composition, electronic performance, sound design, MIDI systems, and multimedia integration.

---

## 🎼 Composition & Performance
- Multi-instrumental composition and arrangement using **Ableton Live, Cubase, FL Studio, Dorico, Sibelius, and Reaper**  
- Piano and drum transcription using professional notation tools (Dorico, Sibelius)  
- Hybrid electronic–acoustic workflows integrating drum modules, MIDI controllers, and virtual instruments  

---

## 🥁 Electronic Drumming & MIDI Systems
- Extensive experience with advanced drum modules: **Roland TD-50**, **Pearl Mimic Pro**, and **AudioFront eDrumin**  
- MIDI-triggered drumming workflows using **Akai MPC**, **Maschine**, and custom finger-drumming setups  
- Development of expressive MIDI configurations for nuanced performance, sampling, and velocity-layered playback  

---

## 🎚 Production Tools & Sound Design
- Utilization of Ableton stock devices, drum racks, custom device chains, and performance templates  
- Implementation of custom production utilities (e.g., *AutoSampler creator*, *AutoSustain tool*)  
  > *(Reminder: you wanted to revise these device names/descriptions — we can refine them whenever you're ready.)*  
- Ongoing work with **SuperCollider** and **PureData** for custom synthesis, algorithmic composition, and data-driven sound design  
- Exploration of **music–science cross-disciplinary synthesis**, using sound generation and DSP to aid in biological or experimental data interpretation  

---

## 🎥 Multimedia, CGI, & Experimental Integration
- Developing interactive audiovisual pipelines integrating  
  **SuperCollider / Reaper / PureData** ↔ **TouchDesigner / Blender**  
- Creating generative visualizations using fractal engines, shader systems, and procedural graphics  
- Building systems where musical gestures modulate CGI environments, animations, and experimental media  

---

## 🧰 Technical Focus Areas
- Drum module design & e-drum integrations  
- Synth analysis & reverse engineering  
- MIDI utilities, routing, and automation  
- Audio production workflows using Ableton, Reaper, RME interfaces, and ATEM-based capture
